# _run.sh — resolve the runner, compose it with this repository's own fragments, and prove they
# actually composed.
#
# Shared by .githooks/pre-commit and scripts/check.sh so both give the identical guarantee, instead of
# only the hook knowing how to invoke this correctly.
#
# THE REASON THIS EXISTS AS A SHARED FILE. A bare `check-agents-md.sh .`, run without
# VIBE_OPS_CHECK_DIRS, composes only the built-in checks and silently omits every fragment this
# repository owns — and still reports "N checks, 0 failed". Someone reaching for the runner directly
# to "just check by hand" gets a clean-looking run that checked none of this repository's own rules.
# scripts/check.sh exists so the correct invocation has a name shorter than the mistake.
#
# The leading underscore keeps this out of the runner's NN-*.sh fragment glob.
#
# Sets RUN_OUTPUT (the runner's stdout+stderr, or an error message) and RUN_RC. Returns 0 only if the
# runner ran AND this repository's fragment directory actually composed into it.

# Where the runner is. Three sources, in this order:
#
#   1. A snapshot copied into this repository at scripts/check-agents-md.sh. It is a SNAPSHOT: it does
#      not update itself, and refreshing it is a deliberate re-copy. First because it is the only source
#      that survives this repository being cloned alone, outside whatever workspace authored it.
#   2. A sibling `vibe-ops` checkout at ../vibe-ops/scripts/check-agents-md.sh, relative to this
#      repository's own root. This is the one to prefer INSIDE a workspace that keeps several
#      repositories beside a shared vibe-ops checkout (entelekheia's Plan-020): there is nothing to
#      refresh, because it is always the live tree, and it costs nothing to add — but it does not exist
#      at all once this repository is cloned on its own, which is exactly why it is not first.
#   3. ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}, when something actually set it.
#
# THE SNAPSHOT IS FIRST BECAUSE THE THIRD SOURCE IS USUALLY ABSENT, and that is easy to get wrong in
# the optimistic direction. Measured 2026-08-07: CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT is unset in an agent's own shell,
# not merely in a git hook — it is exported for processes the plugin runtime spawns, and a command run
# through the agent's shell tool is not one of them. A hook launched from that shell inherits the same
# nothing. So a repository that wants a gate needs the copy, or the sibling, and the third branch
# covers a caller that genuinely has the variable — nothing here should assume one exists.
#
# THE TRADE-OFF THE SIBLING BRANCH MAKES, SAID OUT LOUD: a repository wired to prefer it has no gate at
# all when cloned alone — the sibling directory simply is not there. That is the right shape for a
# workspace-internal standard, shared by several repositories that are never expected to travel apart,
# and the wrong one for a repository that ships its gate to outside contributors. Moving such a
# repository to the snapshot instead needs no change here — branch 1 already wins over branch 2 the
# moment the copy exists.
